## a programmer's text editor

Flow Control is under active development, but very stable.

[]($video.siteAsset('video/flow-control.mp4').controls(true))


## üöÄ Features
- **Lightning Fast** TUI with ‚â§6ms frame times, **low latency** input handling
  and smooth **animated scrolling**
- Intuitive UI with **tabs**, **scrollbars** and **palettes** with full
  **mouse** support for all UI elements
- Support for more than **70 programming languages**, **zero
  configuration** needed, via **tree-sitter** powered syntax highlighting
- **Language Server Protocol** pre configured support for most language servers
- Powerful **multi-cursor** editing and integrated **clipboard history**
- Powerful configurable keybinding system that supports **modal** and
  **non-modal** editing styles
- Multiple pre-configured **keybinding modes**
    - Flow Control - GUI IDE style bindings (similar to vscode)
    - Emacs
    - Vim
    - Helix
    - User created
- Hybrid rope/piece-table buffer system, edit **very large files** with
  **thousands of cursors**
- Full **unicode** support, including support for the kitty text sizing protocol
- Runs on **Linux, FreeBSD, MacOS, Windows and Android** (under termux) with
  easy **cross-compilation** to all supported targets


## Requirements
- A modern terminal with **24bit color** and, ideally, **kitty keyboard
  protocol** support. **Kitty**, **Foot** and **Ghostty** are the recommended
  terminals at this time. **Zellij** also works well. Most other terminals will
  work, but likely with reduced functionality.
- **NerdFont** support. Either via terminal font fallback or a patched font.
- A **UTF-8** locale
