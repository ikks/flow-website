This is a programmer's text editor. It is under active development, but usually stable.

[Demo]($video.siteAsset('video/flow-control.mp4').controls(false))

# Requirements
- A modern terminal with 24bit color and, ideally, kitty keyboard protocol support. Kitty,
    Foot and Ghostty are the only recommended terminals at this time. Most other terminals
    will work, but with reduced functionality.
- NerdFont support. Either via terminal font fallback or a patched font.
- Linux, MacOS, Windows, Android (Termux) or FreeBSD.
- A UTF-8 locale

# Download

Binary release builds are found here: [neurocyte/flow/releases](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow/releases)

Nightly binary builds are found here: [neurocyte/flow-nightly/releases](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow-nightly/releases)

Or check your favorite local system package repository.

# Building from source

See the github page [neurocyte/flow](https://github.com/neurocyte/flow) for instructions.

# Running Flow Control

The binary is:

```
zig-out/bin/flow
```

Place it in your path for convenient access:

```
sudo cp zig-out/bin/flow /usr/local/bin
```

Or if you prefer, let zig install it in your home directory:

```
zig build -Doptimize=ReleaseSafe --prefix ~/.local
```

Flow Control is a single statically linked binary. No further runtime files are required.
You may install it on another system by simply copying the binary.

```
scp zig-out/bin/flow root@otherhost:/usr/local/bin
```

Configuration is mostly dynamically maintained with various commands in the UI.
It is stored under the standard user configuration path. Usually `~/.config/flow`
on Linux. %APPDATA%\Roaming\flow on Windows. Somewhere magical on MacOS

Logs, traces and per-project most recently used file lists are stored in the
standard user application state directory. Usually `~/.local/state/flow` on
Linux and %APPDATA%\Roaming\flow on Windows.

Files to load may be specifed on the command line:

```
flow fileA.zig fileB.zig
```

The last file will be opened and the previous files will be placed in reverse
order at the top of the recent files list. Switch to recent files with Ctrl-e.

Common target line specifiers are supported too:

```
flow file.txt:123
```

Or Vim style:

```
flow file.txt +123
```

Use the --language option to force the file type of a file:

```
flow --language bash ~/.bash_profile
```

Show supported language names with `--list-languages`.

See `flow --help` for the full list of command line options.

# Key bindings and commands

Press `F2` to switch the current keybinding mode. (flow, vim, emacs, etc.)
Press `ctrl+shift+p` or `alt+x` to show the command palette.
Press `ctrl+F2` to see a full list of all current keybindings and commands.

Run the `Edit keybindings` command to save the current keybinding mode to a
file and open it for editing. Save your customized keybinds under a new name
in the same directory to create an entirely new keybinding mode. Keybinding
changes will take effect on restart.

# Terminal configuration

Kitty, Ghostty and most other terminals have default keybindings that conflict
with common editor commands. I highly recommend rebinding them to keys that are
not generally used anywhere else.

For Kitty rebinding `kitty_mod` is usually enough:
```
kitty_mod ctrl+alt
```

For Ghostty each conflicting binding has to be reconfigured individually.

# Features

- multi cursor editing support
- first class mouse support (yes, even with a scrollbar that actually works properly!) (Windows included)
- vscode compatible keybindings (thanks to kitty keyboard protocol)
- vim compatible keybindings (the standard vimtutor bindings, more on request)
